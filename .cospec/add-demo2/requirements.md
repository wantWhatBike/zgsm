# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive support for .coworkflow directory Markdown files in the VS Code extension. It provides file monitoring, CodeLens operations, and visual decorations for task status tracking in requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to monitor .coworkflow directory files, so that I can get real-time updates and interactions with my workflow documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .coworkflow directory exists in the workspace THEN the extension SHALL monitor requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files
2. WHEN any of these files are created, modified, or deleted THEN the extension SHALL update the corresponding providers and decorations
3. WHEN the workspace changes THEN the extension SHALL re-establish file watchers for the new workspace

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CodeLens operations on specific document sections, so that I can quickly perform actions relevant to each document type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing requirements.md THEN the extension SHALL provide "Update" CodeLens actions at appropriate locations
2. WHEN viewing design.md THEN the extension SHALL provide "Update" CodeLens actions at appropriate locations
3. WHEN viewing tasks.md THEN the extension SHALL provide "Run" and "Retry" CodeLens actions for each task item
4. WHEN clicking a CodeLens action THEN the extension SHALL execute the corresponding command with proper context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual status indicators for tasks, so that I can quickly identify task progress at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tasks.md THEN tasks with `[ ]` status SHALL have no background decoration
2. WHEN viewing tasks.md THEN tasks with `[-]` status SHALL have a light yellow background decoration
3. WHEN viewing tasks.md THEN tasks with `[x]` status SHALL have a light green background decoration
4. WHEN task status changes THEN decorations SHALL update automatically
5. WHEN multiple tasks exist THEN each SHALL have independent status decoration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CodeLens to appear at meaningful locations in each document, so that the actions are contextually relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing requirements.md THEN CodeLens SHALL appear at requirement section headers
2. WHEN viewing design.md THEN CodeLens SHALL appear at major section headers
3. WHEN viewing tasks.md THEN CodeLens SHALL appear at individual task items
4. WHEN document structure changes THEN CodeLens positions SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the feature works reliably in various scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN .coworkflow directory doesn't exist THEN the extension SHALL not activate file watchers
2. WHEN monitored files don't exist THEN the extension SHALL handle missing files without errors
3. WHEN files have malformed content THEN the extension SHALL provide basic functionality without crashing
4. WHEN multiple workspaces are open THEN each workspace SHALL have independent file monitoring
